## Introduction:

This is a highly efficient solver to generate trajectories for UAVs. It's basically a C++ wrapper for the C code generated by CVXGEN to solve the optimization problem to generate trajectories for UAVs. 

It includes three solvers to solve for:

* **Velocity-Controlled Trajectories**: State is position.
* **Acceleration-Controlled Trajectories**: States are position and velocity.
* **Jerk-Controlled Trajectories**: States are position, velocity and acceleration,


## Instructions:
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jtorde/uav_trajectory_optimizer.git
```
Now compile the cvxgen code: By default, the compiler will use the option `-Os` for the CVXGEN code. If you want the maximum performance, change it to `-O3` in the Makefile inside the folders cvxgen_*
```
cd uav_trajectory_optimizer
chmod +x setup.sh 
./setup.sh
```
Then compile the c++ wrapper:

```
catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin build
```

And finally execute the example:
```
./build/cvx/cvx_exec
```
